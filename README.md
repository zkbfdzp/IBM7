# ZOSVRG for Generating Universal Attacks on Black-box Neural Networks

ZOSVRG is the proposed new zeroth-order nonconvex optimization method. This repo presents ZOSVRG's application for generating adversarial attacks on black-box neural networks. It contains a pretrained network model for the MNIST classification task, and a Python implementation for attack generation that can directly be applied to the network model.

For the reference of the ZOSVRG algorithm, see “[Zeroth-Order Stochastic Variance Reduction for Nonconvex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10367)” (Hereinafter referred to as Paper.)
