# ZOSVRG for Generating Universal Attacks on Black-box Neural Networks

ZOSVRG is the proposed new zeroth-order nonconvex optimization method. This repo presents the application of ZO-SVRG for generation of adversarial attacks on black-box neural networks. Specifically, the repo contains a Python implementation for generating black-box attacks on neural networks trained for MNIST classification task.

For the reference of the ZOSVRG algorithm, see “[Zeroth-Order Stochastic Variance Reduction for Nonconvex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10367)” (Hereinafter referred to as Paper.)
